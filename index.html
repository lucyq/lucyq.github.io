			<br>

			<p class="info_text">I'm a recent graduate from Tufts University with a B.S. in computer science and economics. During the beginning of junior fall, I began programming for the first time and found that it was something that challenged me both creatively and intellectually. Since then I have been trying to absorb as much as I can and have completed the computer science curriculum in a year in a half while taking the initiative to find projects to develop my skills.



		 	<br><br>
			My interests within computer science are still evolving as I continue to explore the field. I really enjoy the design process, whether that's visual and involves playing with colors in a data visualization or spatial and involves creating an efficient data structure to solve the current problem at hand. I've really enjoyed learning about a wide variety of topics including networks, computer architecture, and the theories behind programming languages but what really excites me is the potential to turn ideas into something tangible. My interests within economics are in centered on economic development and urbanization and I hope to later merge this background with my programming skills and possibly apply them to international issues such as conflict, health and disaster response.
			<br><br>
			When I'm not staring at my computer screen, I enjoy writing, exploring Boston, cooking/eating delicious food, meeting new people and <a href="travel.html" style="text-decoration: underline">planning my next adventure.</a>
