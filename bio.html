<h1>Brief Biography</h1>
Lucy Qin grew up in Stony Brook, NY, a standard Long Island suburb near the rocky sound. She later went to Ward Melville High School, where her interests in international affairs, writing, and history first blossomed. After graduation, she bought a t-shirt with an elephant on it and packed it in her suitcase as she drove off to another suburb on the East Coast: Medford, MA. She currently studies at Tufts University and can be seen pulling all nighters in Eaton Hall, making waffles in Carmichael Hall, and delving deeper into economics in Braker. Most recently she has been sighted in Halligan, making tea on nights when large projects are due. She has been trekking up and down this hilly campus for three years now yet she is still unclear about where she wants to go after graduation and is open to many possibilities. She is still waiting for her seemingly divergent interests to merge so for now, she is content to wander around Boston in her assortment of scarves, appreciating the fact that her time in college is of a transient nature.
